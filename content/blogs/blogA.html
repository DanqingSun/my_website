<p>My name is Danqing Sun. I was born and grew up in China. I am enrolled in the Masters of Financial Analysis program in London Business School and I received my undergraduate education in Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China. My major in University is also Finance.</p>
<p>As to my interest and hobbies, I have to say I am an animal-lover and I raise a dog and a cat as pets. Zoos have long been my favorite places.</p>

<p>Besides, I love traveling around in my spare time and I spent four years exploring the Hangzhou where my university is located. I definitely recommend you a tour to the city. With the West Lake located in the center of the city, Hangzhou has the most beautiful scenery in the world.</p>
